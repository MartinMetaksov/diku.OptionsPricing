% V. HYBRID ANALYSIS (combines the advantages of static + dynamic, i.e., accurate at the cost of negligible runtime overhead)

% -- for example used in the context of automatic parallelization, i.e., aggressively generates a cascade of "sufficient conditions" for the loop to be parallel; these are statically generated, but are tested at runtime; if none succeeds the loop is executed sequentially otherwise in parallel. 
% It is shown that a large class of statically-unknown parallel loop can be identified, and moreover that the overhead is negligible in most cases (<1% of loop's runtime and in few cases the overhead is still significant, but it scales with parallelism -- i.e., the predicate is executed in parallel ...)

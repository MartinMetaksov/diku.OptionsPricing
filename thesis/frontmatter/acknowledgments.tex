First and foremost, we would like to thank Cosmin E. Oancea and Wojciech M. Pawlak for their supervision and dedication to this project. For all the guidance on financial terminology, parallel transformations, CUDA programming and all related topics we have discussed. For the number of hours each of them have spent thoroughly reading this thesis and guided us in improving it. 

We would also like to thank Troels Henriksen for his quick responses on GitHub and his help with Futhark.
